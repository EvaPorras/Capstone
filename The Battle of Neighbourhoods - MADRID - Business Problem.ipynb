Also we will analyse those boroughs with highest increase ratios.\n\nOn the other hand, we will analyze the number of pets per neighborhood and the number of veterinarians to detect those neighborhoods with the highest ratios of pets per veterinarian (i.e. with more needing of locating a new facility). \n\nWith these two criteria we will cluster the neighbourhoods to detect the most promissing neighborhoods to install a new veterinary clinic (and the most \"saturated\" neighbourhood to avoid).
