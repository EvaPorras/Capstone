We will extract the name of the boroughs, neighbourhoods and their location.\n\n- number of pets in the last five years: City Hall Public Data web publishes the number of dogs and cats per borough in the last 5 years. We will extract the increase of the number of total pets per borough. On the other hand, since the number of pets is published per borough, we use the proportion of population to distribute the number of pets per neighbourhood.\n\n- number of veterinary in every neighborhood: City Hall Public Data web publishes the active venues in Madrid (163251 venues). We will extract the number of veterinary clinics per neighbourhood.\n\n(Note:I have decided not to use the Foursquare API since not so much venues are registered in application yet. A checking of this is included in the code)\n\nAs final dataframe we will have per each neighbourhood:\n- Borough\n- Location: Latitude and Longitude\n- Total Number of pets\n- Increase of the number of pets in the last 5 years\n- Number of veterinarian clinics\n- Ratio pets/vet\n",
