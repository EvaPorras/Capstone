Also we will analyse those boroughs with highest increase ratios.\n\nOn the other hand, we will analyze the number of pets per neighborhood and the number of veterinarians to detect those neighborhoods with the highest ratios of pets per veterinarian (i.e. with more needing of locating a new facility). \n\nWith these two criteria we will cluster the neighbourhoods to detect the most promissing neighborhoods to install a new veterinary clinic (and the most \"saturated\" neighbourhood to avoid). This information is fundamental for a veterinarian who decide to open a new veterinarian clinic in Madrid.",

As the number of pets is published per borough, we use the proportion of population to distribute the number of pets per neighbourhood. \n- number of veterinaries in every neighborhood will be obtained also from the City Hall Public Data Web since not so much venues are registered in the Foursquare API yet. So it is not appropiate to use in Madrid (checking of this is included in the analisys).\n\n",
